# My simple implementation of the Grover algorithm in Q#

I just read the Wikipedia article about the Grover algorithm and decided to have some fun by trying to implement it in Q#.

I may not be entirely correct and I did this just to practice some Q#. 

# How to run

dotnet run

# Grover explained in simple terms:

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can search an unsorted database (or an arbitrary list of N elements) in âˆšN steps, which is a significant improvement over classical algorithms which, on average, need N/2 steps.

# Unit is Adj

This is not a data type, it just means that the operation doesn't have a return value.
